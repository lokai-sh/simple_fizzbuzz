# fizzbuzz
Simple FizzBuzz game coded in Ruby.

Game Objective:
To count up from 1 to 100 and use the following rules:
- When the number is a multiple of 3 we output Fizz
- When the number is a multiple of 5 we output Buzz
- When the number is both a multiple of 3 and 5 we output FizzBuzz
- Otherwise we output the number

Purpose of the project:
To learn how to use RSpec and BDD (Behaviour Driven Design) which is similar to the TDD I used in the past with Java.


Could look at re-writing the project to include one or more of the following:
- Accept parameters for the range
  Initially I had this coded in but when I went to run the specs they failed as there was a check for parameters that was failing
- Prompt users for the range
