This is my first project written using BDD (Behaviour Driven Design) which is similar to the TDD I used to used

The game is FizzBuzz

The objective is to count up from 1 to 100 and use the following rules:
- When the number is a multiple of 3 we output Fizz
- When the number is a multiple of 5 we output Buzz
- When the number is both a multiple of 3 and 5 we output FizzBuzz
- Otherwise we output the number
